# Hasura-Assignment
This repository is created to make the submission of the problem statements/assignment.

## Multiples
Following is the logic for Python implementation-
1. Input n, m.
2. Input magic-number and corresponding substitute in key-value form in a dictionary.
3. For (num) numbers 1 to n, check if num is a multiple of each magic number. If it is, print the substitute of the magic-number, else, print num itself.

The GoLang implementation makes use of 2 arrays rather than a dictionary.

## Flipbook
This problem statement requires one to design a compiler. I've chosen to write it in Python.

Status: In progress

 - [x] Write the Parser
 - [x] Write the Lexer
 - [ ] Write semantics and validate
 - [ ] Testing
